# World Happiness Report

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks more than 150 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. The report is a publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. 

Data is collected from people in over 150 countries. Each variable measured reveals a populated-weighted average score on a scale running from 0 to 10 that is tracked over time and compared against other countries. These variables currently include:

- GDP per Capita
- Family
- Life Expectancy
- Freedom
- Generosity
- Trust Government Corruption 

Each country is also compared against a hypothetical nation called Dystopia. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key metrics, thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive (or zero) width. The six metrics are used to explain the estimated extent to which each of these factors contribute to increasing life satisfaction when compared to the hypothetical nation of Dystopia, but they themselves do not have an impact on the total score reported for each country.
